COEN 11: Advanced Programming
Santa Clara University, Dr. Angela Musurlian, Winter 2020

This includes various C projects from the lab section of this course

Lab 1 - Webpage (HTML): Create a personalized webpage

Lab 2 - Waiting List (Functions): A restaurant reservation/waiting list system that inserts, removes and lists reservations

Lab 3 - Waiting List (Structures): Building on the previous lab, this implements an array of structures and adds functions to search by size and check for duplicates.

Lab 4 - Waiting List (Unions): Building on the previous lab, this implements unions into the struct and takes in extra information for each restaurant reservation, including name, size, and special occasions.

Lab 5 - Waiting List (Linked Lists): Building on Lab 3, this implements a linked list where each node has a name and number of people in the party.

Lab 6 - Waiting List (Array of Linked Lists): Building on the previous lab, this creates a waiting list with 4 ranges of group sizes (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7+), one linked list per range.

Lab 7 - Waiting List (File I/O): Building on either Lab 5 or 6, this saves the reservation information into a text file.

Lab 8 - Waiting List (Recursion): Building on the previous lab, this adds recursive functions that list the reservations backwards and shows each name backwards.

Lab 9 - Waiting List (Threads): Building on the previous lab, this adds functionality to auto-save the info from the waiting list to a binary file every 15 seconds.
